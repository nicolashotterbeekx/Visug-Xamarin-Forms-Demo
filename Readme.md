# Visug Demo 

The application contains a demo for:

- A simple renderer. A renderer chaning the border color/thickness for an entry.

- A custom control. A control that moves the placeholder of an entry to a label above on Windows Phone.

- Native styling. A tabbed page for Windows Phone using App.xaml in the Windows Phone project.

- Style inheritance. Click on the "Enable/disable button" to enable the "Style inheritance" button. Next you can click on it to see the demo.

- Dependency injection. Shows how you can inject platform dependent implementations using unity to avoid if/else statements. *The implementation for iOS is missing in the project*.


Have fun!
